# Blockchain & AI-Based Account Data System for Domestic Violence (DV)

## Project Summary
This repository contains a prototype for a secure and intelligent system combining blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the handling of domestic violence (DV) cases. The system addresses challenges such as data siloing, evidence tampering, resource allocation, and risk assessment, while improving services for survivors and aiding law enforcement.

## Key Features
1. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Immutable storage of evidence and records.
   - Secure data sharing across agencies.
   - Smart contracts for automated workflows like fund allocation and reporting.

2. **AI Implementation**:
   - Enhanced risk assessment using machine learning.
   - Early prediction of high-risk cases.
   - Automated case prioritization and resource allocation.

3. **Data Privacy & Security**:
   - Cryptographic protection for sensitive data.
   - Blockchain ledger ensures data integrity and transparency.

## Technologies
- **Blockchain Framework**: Hyperledger Fabric (or Ethereum for smart contracts).
- **AI Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, or PyTorch.
- **Backend**: Python/Flask.
- **Frontend**: React.js (optional prototype UI).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the backend server: `python app.py`.
4. (Optional) Deploy the blockchain network using Docker or a cloud platform.
5. Access AI tools via API endpoints for analysis and reporting.

## Legal Disclaimer
This is a prototype for educational and demonstration purposes only. Real-world implementation requires compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and authorization from relevant authorities.
